  title: Encrypted Indicators
  description: "Because what we needed was harder edgework, this widget aims to make
    you perpetually unsure of what indicators are present. Included is an appendix
    page containing a decryption guide.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This widget only works with mod
    modules. The vanilla modules are not powerful enough to solve the encryption!\r\n\r\nFor
    your convenience, you can lower the maximum number of encrypted indicators in
    the settings file. (This won't stop them from spawning, but they will NOT be encrypted!)"
